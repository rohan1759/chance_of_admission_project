# 🎓 Chance of Admission — Complete Internship Project

This repository contains a complete, ready-to-run internship project based on the **"Chance of Admission"** problem (predicting graduate admission chances).  
It includes: dataset handling, model training, a saved ML model, a Flask backend API, and a minimal React frontend to demonstrate predictions.

> ✅ This project was built from the YBI Foundation Internship repository idea and delivered as a full end-to-end implementation.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the **Graduate Admission dataset** (commonly available on Kaggle).  
Features include:

- GRE Score  
- TOEFL Score  
- University Rating  
- SOP  
- LOR  
- CGPA  
- Research  
- Chance of Admit (target)  

📌 Save the dataset as `data/admission_data.csv`.

If Kaggle access is not available, you can create a small synthetic CSV with the same column names to test.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🔹 Backend (Flask API)

1. Navigate into backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
````

2. Create virtual environment & install requirements:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Train the model (generates `models/admission_model.pkl`):

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Runs on: `http://localhost:5000`

### 🔹 Frontend (React UI)

1. Navigate into frontend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start frontend:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Runs on: `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.
2. Enter values for GRE, TOEFL, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and Research.
3. Submit → The React frontend calls the Flask backend → You’ll get the predicted **chance of admission (0–100%)**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Python 3.8+** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Flask, Flask-CORS, Joblib)
* **React (18.x)** for frontend
* **RandomForestRegressor** (can be swapped with Linear Regression, XGBoost, etc.)

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* Improve UI with Material UI / TailwindCSS
* Add input validation and error handling
* Experiment with multiple ML models & compare results
* Deploy:

  * Backend → Render/Heroku
  * Frontend → Netlify/Vercel
